# FriendFinder

What the project does:
This application matches the user with a new friend based on how they answered a survey. The survey asks for the user's opinion on 10 well-known people using a scale of 1-5. The differences between the user's answers and the answers of the other people who have used the app will be calculated, averaged, and that score will determine who's the best match.

Why the project is useful:
This project combines front-end and back-end technologies to create an API of users that it pulls from and pushes to, dynamically altering the HTML along the way.
